# Handwritten Digit Classification 🖊️🔢🧠

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository is centered around building and training a neural network to classify handwritten digits using the renowned MNIST database. The MNIST database is a staple in the machine learning community, often used for benchmarking classification algorithms. It comprises 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, sourced from high school students and U.S. Census Bureau employees.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Comprehensive MNIST Dataset**: Utilizes the MNIST database, a large collection of handwritten digits, for training and testing the model.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Involves flattening the 2D images into 1D vectors and normalizing the pixel values.
- **Neural Network Modeling**: Creation of a Sequential model in Keras with dense layers and the ‘relu’ and 'softmax' activation functions.
- **Categorical Classification**: Implements one-hot encoding for target variable classification.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained on the dataset and evaluated using accuracy metrics.

## 🛠️ Built With
- Keras: For building and training the neural network.
- Python: For overall data handling and processing.
- Matplotlib: For visualization of MNIST digits.
- Numpy: For numerical operations on data.

## 🎯 Application Scenarios
- **Image Classification**: Useful as a starting point for more complex image recognition and processing tasks.
- **Benchmarking Algorithms**: Can serve as a benchmark to test the efficiency of different neural network architectures and parameters.

## 🔍 Inside the Code
- **Data Visualization**: Includes code for visualizing the MNIST dataset images.
- **Model Architecture**: Detailed explanation of the neural network layers, activation functions, and the rationale behind their selection.
- **Model Training**: In-depth look at the training process, including validation splits and epoch settings.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation of the model based on accuracy and error rates.
